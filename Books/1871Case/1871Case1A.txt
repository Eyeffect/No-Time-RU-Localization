<SHERIFF>
After a lengthy interrogation I managed to deduct that the thieves have been hiding underneath the well known waterfall in the west. 
That is when I ambushed and defeated the 20 bandits and their boss.
My new friend helped me in the ambush by his clever distraction.
I recovered a load of <REDACTED> material from the cave.
All the captured bandits are to be relocated to Isla de los tontos charged for robbery.
By the speedy aid of my friend, their attempt to escape with the stolen treasure was halted.
The treasure was recovered after me and my colleague halted at byroad.
