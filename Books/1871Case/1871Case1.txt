<SHERIFF>
After a lengthy interrogation I managed to deduct that the thieves have been hiding underneath the well known waterfall in the west. 
That is when I ambushed and defeated the 20 bandits and their boss.
The whereabouts of the stolen goods could not be recovered.
I however recovered a load of <REDACTED> material from the cave.
All the captured bandits are to be relocated to Isla de los tontos charged for robbery.
<END OF REPORT>
