Chapter 7:

Manmade monolith?

North of Byroad, lies the Redrock Peninsula. There can be found an odd shaped rock monument thought by many to be the remnant of a millenia old civilisation.

It is made of seemingly perfectly cut slabs of stones, with a rock balanced on top.

The archeologists found that this must be likely a natural rock which was used as the site of an ancient stone quarry.
