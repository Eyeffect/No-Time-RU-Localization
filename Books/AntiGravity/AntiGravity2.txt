Better yet, the device would slowly charge up in energy. Further tests proved that the effect was different from the ionic wind, that was thought was the only effect from Browns experiments in the 1920s.

Further experiments proved perfect performance in earth orbit vacuum, so there was a force not bound by ion particles. Later, it was discovered that voltage was not the key factor, but the ability of creating an electric field and making it strong enough to have near zero leakage of energy. The great breakthrough was when it was found out, that the device could be scaled down and keep the same amount of thrust. This meant if the device could be scaled down and linked with many more smaller devices, the machine would compound more thrust!
