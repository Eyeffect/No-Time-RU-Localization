<MR. FALLONE>
(Stirs in order to get up and leave) I have two children and a wife, I need to go home, I cannot stay.

<DETECTIVE>
Oh, not so hasty Mr. Fallone. You haven’t  been in any relationship, as far as I know.
I will of course make good what was wronged against you, in case you do have a family to take care of. You have my promise.

<EXPOSITION>
After a series of unsuccessful investigations, police inquiries ceased.
Neither the full extent of, or the reason behind the murders were found out.
