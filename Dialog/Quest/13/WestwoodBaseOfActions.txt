Wait Clint Westwood?
...
How come you are here?
Some weirdly clothed guys showed up and then I woke up here.
Fair enough.
Anyway we came to rescue you.
Thank you stranger. There is another prisoner. He is upstairs.
Then we need to help him as well!
I will lead follow me!
Strange guy. I will lead on then!
...Ah and who are you?
Wait you are Clint Westwood!
Yes?
We came to rescue you.
I thank you stranger. We better move ...down along the corridor.
Yes?
Henry asked for you... What are you doing out here?
(Is silent) I'll go just give me a bit... Well I just meditated a bit, needed some quiet. Time Travel, mad time agents, crazy world to live in... I need a bit of time to settle my heart and mind. AD 33 just seems perfect, so much more quiet than these futuristic 1940s where you saved me from... Thanks.
Yes? 
Well, you're welcome!
(Pauses) ...You should try it some time. Just enjoying nature and the sounds of it.
Do you recall the place?
I remember a mansion. It was situated in a high area. I saw the mountain so it must be a its foot hills to in the northern region of the island... They mentioned something about 1975. I hope it is the right year. I do not remember anything more.
Very lifelike...
I do.
I was held underneath a mansion of sorts for a time. I believe in 1970.
They were working on some tracking devices, as they called it.
To search for you two.
They mentioned your names...
We meet again, friend.
