Mr. Crimson
I am not done yet!
...
After this little interruption of yours, our allies will finally establish open control over the whole world! My master will be pleased with my work.
He is going to kill you after he's done.
How would you know that? He has been the only one who's cared for me in all that time! He supported me! Not you, or your foolish friend. I was thrown out of university I lost everything, if it were not for his help! The world had it's chance to be kind towards me!
I understand that you had to suffer alot!
Spare your breath, you will need it after you get thrown out into the deep outside! I think I'll let your old friend Edward watch you die.
I know there is good in you! Help me to make things right!
You forget that I know how you reacted last time I offered you friendship. My older self wrote a lengthy letter, how you scolded my ambitions to make the world a better place!
(Sigh) You don't know the effect of your actions yet.
(Thinks) I see... Well now that you are here. Let us test your time core and see if it works. (Emotionless) And after all this we will do away with you!
This is not the end! ARRGGHH!
----------------------
I knew it! My younger self got the message!
Ho, Hold on.. where are you going?! (looks at you)     ...You!
Agent come back here! Hey!
Hey!
Heeeeeyyyy!!!

A voice
Leave him!
Is that how you treat people who come to visit our nice undersea shelter?
Please. Step forward!
I am so sorry for the inconvenience.
Our defense units overreacted a bit.
